This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Go `with-form/page_b`, fill anything in input text
2. Press Enter and form submit occurs, and page would be on `with-form/page_a`
3. You can see text just typed page b.
